I am a biomedical engineering student who loves to run heavy computational simulations that involves drug delivery, the effects of ultrasound in drug delivery and blood brain barrier rupture using microbubbles. I believe being able to save memory on computer and knowing how computer system works would give me the opportunity to be a better programmer and an engineer. I am hoping after finishing this course I would be a step closer to making my own small (or maybe one day big) efficient software to run simulations.
